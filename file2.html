  <div class="matter"> 	<p>Using Azure App Service, as it enables us to build and host web applications in
    the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. 
    So it easy to create website and host it by using <u>MONGODB</u> as a platform for hosting.</p>
    <br> <br> <br> <h2><center><b><u>MONGODB As a DATABASE SERVICES(ATLAS) </u> </b></center></h2><br> 
    <br <p>MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, 
    managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS , Azure, 
    and GCP). MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, run, and scale MongoDB in the cloud..</p> <br>
  <p>So we can use the database for my website and use it to reside my all the database inside this.</p> 
  <br> <p>This feature today used by different companies which may help them to Implement there ideas
  and probably work on it.</p> <br> <br></p> <img src="Atlas.png" class="logo"> <br><br> 			
<br> <br> <h3><u>Achieve global scale on Demand</u></h3> <p> Get high availability within and across 
  different regions provided by mongodb with the use of different cloud services such as azure,google 
  cloud,Amazon web services as you deploy data and host services across multiple locations with one mouse 
  click. Automatically scale vertically and horizontally based on application performance or customisable rules 
  to handle peaks in workload automatically while minimising costs during off-peak times. </p> <br><br>

<p> Many developers, accustomed to using RDBMS for decades, may not be aware of the advantages that NoSQL 
  databases bring to applications built for today's internet. These advantages include:

Ability to easily accommodate evolving schemas and data models as applications grow and change.Scaling for massive 
  amounts of data spread out across multiple data stores.High-speed performance for querying that associates complex and 
  related data.Support for analytics operations through complex queries.Flexibility in deployment options — on-prem
  in a private cloud, or in the public cloud.</p> <br> <br> <img src="NoSQL.jpg" alt="" class="logo">
